### Image classification
A competition on the Kaggle platform, the so-called Community-competition, that is, 
for a study group, without overall rating points on the platform.

Points for this task are distributed as follows:
  * 10 points for overcoming base_solution
  * 10 points for overcoming sol2 (20 in total)
  * 10 points for overcoming sol3 (30 in total)
  * 10 points for overcoming sol6 (40 in total)
  * 30 points for clear code and report in a notebook
  * 30 points can be obtained for the completeness of the experiments. 
  You are expected to try several convolutional network architectures with different parameters, 
  maybe make an ensemble. The competition will last 3 weeks until December 19, 
  you can see the exact end time on the Kaggle.

  About bonus points for prizes:
  1st place +500 points, 2nd place +300 points, 3rd place +200 points.

  4-10 places +50 points.
