Points for this task are distributed as follows:
   * 20 points for any first submission
   * 60 points for overcoming DTC_benchmark. Testing takes place in two stages. 
Half of the answers are checked immediately (open part) and the results are displayed on the public leaderboard. 
The second half (closed part) will be checked after the end of the competition. 
Of all the points, you will receive 40 for the result in the open part and 20 for the result in the closed part. 
You will have to choose the two submissions that you want to evaluate on the closed part. Your result will be the better of the two.
   * 20 points can be obtained for the code and support for it. Of these, 10 points are for the quality of the code (it must be understandable) 
and 10 points for the completeness of the experiments. You are expected to try several methods with different parameters, 
use cross-validation, and examine the distribution of features. You should write report with analysis â€” 
why you think that the selected final method is best suited for solving this problem. 

Submit the accompanying code/report in the comments to the assignment on the website.

Good luck and enjoy the competition!
