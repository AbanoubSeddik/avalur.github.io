						I am thrilled to present to you the results of a groundbreaking study
						published on the 17th of January, 2024, in 'Nature.'
						This study introduces us to AlphaGeometry, an Olympiad-level artificial intelligence system
						designed specifically to tackle complex school geometry tasks.

						Now, let's quantify 'impressive,' shall we?
						AlphaGeometry has achieved a remarkable feat by successfully solving 25 out of the 30
						International Mathematical Olympiad, or IMO, geometry problems.
						To put this achievement into perspective, the previous best method could only solve 10 problems
						and average human doesn't solve even one problem.

						But how did AlphaGeometry reach such proficiency? By harnessing existing symbolic engines and
						applying them to a diverse set of random theorem premises,
						the AI managed to extract an astonishing 100 million synthetic theorems and their corresponding proofs.
						Many of these proofs contain over 200 proof steps, which is four times longer
						than the average proof length found in Olympiad theorems.
						This is no small feat and speaks volumes about the AI's deep understanding of geometry.

						Moreover, AlphaGeometry produced nearly 10 million synthetic proof steps
						that involve constructing auxiliary points.
						This is particularly noteworthy because it signifies a leap beyond
						the realm of pure symbolic deduction.
						The AI is not just following a set of rules; it's exhibiting an understanding
						of geometry that allows it to reach solutions in a way that's reminiscent
						of human intuition and creativity.

						The implications of this advancement are profound. They not only revolutionize
						the way we approach mathematical problems but also pave the way for future applications
						of AI in education and beyond.

						And of course, students master new technologies just as well as you and I or even better.
						<br>
						Consider two typical examples from students of our educational program in Cyprus.
						NADEZHDA with her friends had one exam in the format of solving practical cases.
						They had to prepare using only two task samples from the teacher.
						So they added the theory from the slides of all the lectures into the GPT,
						followed it with exam samples. And asked AI to generate
						similar samples based on the received theory.
						It was a superfast preparation for this kind of exam!
						<br>
						Let's look at another example from YAROSLAV.
						He was given some task, to write some kind of convolutional neural network.
						Initially, when looking at such a task, it is not always clear how to approach
						it and where to start. In the past, Google solved this, helping with existing solutions
						and showing how related tasks are done.
						<br>
						Now ChatGPT just writes the first version of code.
						Usually, approximately 20% of this code remains in the final version of neural network;
						sometimes it writes completely inadequate code, which, however, helps to understand what to Google next.
						In the following process of execution, Yaroslav uses ChatGPT as a bug fixer.

						So what are the pros and cons of using ChatGPT in studying?
						<br>
						Let's begin with the USEFUL CASES.
						<br>
						It HELPS answer questions for tools with poor or inaccessible documentation
						(for example, it can tell you how to start using GNU Debugger).
						<br>
						It PROVIDES nice and quick examples for some JSONs and other objects,

						<br>
						ONE of the main points: it helps to overcome the fear of a “blank slate.”
						<br>
						And WHAT it doesn't handle well:
						<br>
						Definitely it is ANY TASK where you have a large general context of the whole project.
						<br>
						ALSO, it is non-typical problems in not so popular areas:
						if you ask to solve a dynamic programming problem in Haskell, it gives funny answers,

						Let's switch gears and dive into my personal story and also let's try to think, if AI replace me?
						<br>
						I was BORN and raised in faraway snowy Novosibirsk in a beautiful Soviet family:
						mother is a doctor, father is an engineer, also I have an older brother.
						<br>
						Childhood in the 90s was fun: garages and unfinished buildings as playground,
						the sea and the forest instilled a love of sports and tourism.
						In school, about the fifth grade I tried mathematics,
						already in the seventh grade I won the regional math olympiad. It was almost a miracle.
						Away we go — a physics and mathematics school in the legendary AKADEMGORODOK,
						close to Obges, which is microdistrict. Then MATH at Novosibirsk State University, science...
						The MOTTO was "You could not be a scientist, but a candidate of science must be!” =)
						So I made my PhD thesis in math modeling there in the Institute of Computational Techonlogies.
						<br>
						In graduate school, I wanted to try something else.
						In parallel, the hype about machine learning grew;
						a YANDEX company wanted to come to Novosibirsk with the development office and
						Yandex Data School.
						This chance could not be missed, and I was fortunate to simultaneously
						become a curator and student of the Yandex School Novosibirsk branch.
						It was truly challenging: I even took academic leave for the first time in my life.
						Before my graduation in the fourth semester,
						we had a daughter in our family, but I liked everything and was happy :)
						I already worked as a data scientist at YANDEX for the graduation from Yandex Data School.
						<br>
						It was super-useful for about three years of experience in industrial programming and analytics,
						but I became increasingly aware that I was drawn back to teaching, science and organizing education.
						<br>
						So I moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a HEAD of
						the machine learning bachelor program in the new department of mathematics and
						computer science of St. Petersburg State University.
						It was such an educational startup within the university — a very strong team,
						support from Yandex, JetBrains, Gazprom Neft and other companies,
						many ambitious tasks and one big goal to create something like MIT or even better in Russia.
						<br>
						Now I am working here at JetBrains, developing a new bachelor program
						"Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence" with Neapolis University.
						<br>
						So now goes an intriguing question, can or when does AI replace me?
						<br>
						The researchers tested GPT-3.5, the previous best model from OpenAI,
						on reasoning problems found in intelligence tests and exams like the SAT.
						Notably, SAT is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States.
						It is a multiple-choice, pencil-and-paper test that measures
						a student's reading, writing, and math skills.
						Surprisingly, GPT-3.5 performed impressively well,
						solving 75% of the problems in SAT Math correctly. This outperformed the average score of human participants.
						<br>
						Notably, GPT-4v performed even better on SATs. It scored 700 out of 800 points
						on the math SAT. Personally, I tested GPT-4v on some assignments of Yandex Data School,
						and it solved a lot of them successfully.
						<br>
						Anyway, I can still DRIVE a car, understand people, and hope that it will help me pay the bills.

						Let me switch gears second time and share my own workflow for teaching and lecture preparation.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, I usually work in PyCharm complemented with the TeXiFy IDEA plugin.
						This combination brings together LaTeX, Python, and JavaScript all in one place.
						It allows using powerful autocompletion and inspections of PyCharm,
						and inverse search from pdf.
						<br>
						NEXT, let's discuss the AI Assistant.
						It is capable of assisting with translations in a broader sense.
						AI helper is not just restricted to translating languages;
						it can convert formats, elaborate short ideas into detailed descriptions,
						and even to oral speech, facilitate auto tests creation, and more.
						<br>
						THIRDLY, I'm using the GitHub Copilot plugin.
						It offers practical pieces of code,
						draft solutions, and generally helps speed up the writing of text content
						for my instructions or lectures.
						<br>
						LAST but not least, the Grazie Pro plugin checks for typos and polishes long sentences.
						Its purpose is to ensure your text is clean, concise, and clear before reaching your audience.

				<section data-background-image="images/problem_to_IMC2024.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here I'd like to show the concrete example from my own experience. It is producing
						the problem for the International Mathematical Competition.
						<br>
						First of all, I have chosen an appropriate problem from ancient times of my teaching
						at Novosibirsk State University. There I organized math contests with tricky olimpiad tasks.
						So I need to translate the problem from Russian to English and
						to make a Latex format from Microsoft Word.
						<br>
						You see, with the help of AI assistant; I can do it in a few seconds.
						Here I simply copy-paste the answer to the working area.
						Then I check the result and look at the Grazie suggestions.
						Here I don't accept it, because it suggests something strange
						about additional dot in the text after the word "elements",
						but often it helps to polish the text.
						<br>
						Then I compile Tex sources and look at PDF file.
						<br>
						Then I need to write a solution, so I think through the solution and type it in Latex format.
						So firstly, I write x^2 = 0, then latex Rightarrow command goes.
						Here you can see that GitHub Copilot helps me to write the solution very quickly;
						it even makes simple calculation with math formulas.
						<br>
						Then I write the second part of the solution. Here I need to prove that
						the product being equal to zero is commutative. So that ab=0 if and only if ba=0.
						You see, sometimes I disagree with the Copilot's suggestions, but often it helps.
						Eventually, I check everything, recompile Tex sources and get the final PDF file done.
						Really fast, effective and convenient workflow, at least for me.
						Maybe you will consider using something similar for your own practice.

						This speed makes a significant impact.
						<br>
						For instance, IMAGINE we discover something on Twitter today.

						Here in the final part of the talk, let's look at
						the practical use-cases of AI that teachers are utilizing right now.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, AI can significantly streamline the creation of lecture materials.
						With a simple prompt, AI can help you generate a detailed lecture outline
						and even convert that outline into visually engaging slides using tools like reveal.js.
						This is a great example of how AI can facilitate the preparation process for educators.
						<br>
						NEXT, teachers are experimenting with AI's capabilities by checking the effectiveness
						of LLM in answering assignment questions.
						This not only tests the AI's understanding but also helps to identify
						how students might use such technology to aid their learning.
						<br>
						In the realm of ART and visuals, DALL-E 3 is another remarkable tool.
						It's capable of creating nice, high-quality illustrations,
						whether in raster or in vector formats.
						These illustrations can then be used to enhance teaching materials and engage students.
						<br>
						LASTLY, AI is taking on the task of handling routine responsibilities.
						From drafting course syllables to managing other repetitive tasks,
						AI is opening up space for teachers to focus on more personalized and creative aspects of their work.

						As we reach the final of the presentation, I'd like to leave you with some takeaways.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, the panorama of reliable information sources has evolved over the centuries.
						From the era of oral traditions to the digital age of AI, we have witnessed a monumental shift.
						Yet one constant remains — the need for critical thinking and verification.
						In today's fast-paced world, this need is not just constant but has become more crucial than ever.
						<br>
						SECONDLY, the incredible speed at which information is now accessible presents us
						with new opportunities.
						It allows for rapid learning, immediate access to knowledge,
						and the ability to connect globally.
						However, it also demands from us a heightened sense of discernment and responsibility.
						<br>
						As a COMPANY, addressing these changes means adapting and innovating.
						We already have 'JetBrains AI platform', integrated across all the products,
						improving our workflows and decision-making processes.
						<br>
						FINALLY, we don't just adapt but lead.
						We have the opportunity to be pioneers in integrating AI into education tools.
						By doing this, we can shape a smarter, more efficient learning environment.
						<br>
						So, I invite you to JOIN us in teaching and
						in development new learning environment; it's really fun and exciting.
						<br>
						Your thoughts, FEEDBACK, and ideas are invaluable.
						I encourage you to connect with me on Telegram or GitHub.
						Let's collaborate and shape the future of education together.
						Thank you.
						<br>
						Happy New Year and Merry Christmas!
