						Hello everyone!
						I'm Aleksandr Avdiushenko, and I am thrilled to have a talk here in Cyprus Open.
						We will discuss the evolution of education and its interconnection with technology.

						Essentially, the talk will consist of two parts:
						the first one is more historical and philosophical, and the second is more practical and useful, I hope.

						  Let's start with the brief history of human education and knowledge sharing development.
						  <br>
						  So THE FIRST STEP of our journey is oral tradition.
						  It was the only way of sharing knowledge about three thousand Before Christ's Era:
						  In the earliest days of human civilization, information was transferred
						  orally from generation to generation.
						  Storytelling, folklore, and hands-on experiences were
						  the primary and the only methods for education.
						  <br>
						  So, oral speech is reliable!

						  Let's go on!
						  <br>
						  Around five thousand years ago, in ancient Mesopotamía,
						  the first known writing system, cuneiform, was developed.
						  Probably, you have heard about it.
						  This was closely tied with the invention of numbers and basic arithmetic,
						  which allowed for record-keeping and administration of transactions, mostly in marketplaces.
						  <br>
						  First of all, there was needed convenient notation and the ability to accumulate knowledge.
						  Fun thing to know about this piece of history is
						  that the first forms of writing were about accounting and credits
						  long precede the invention of money.
						  <br>
						  Well, clay tablets are reliable!

					<aside class="notes">
						It is also interesting and quite well-known that cuneiform numerical notation was base sixty,
						unlike our base ten numbers, but they had a true place value system like we do, not like
						Roman numerals. So the position of each digit within a number determines its value.

						  Ok, now we move on to the third stage, which was connected with Scrolls and Libraries.
						  <br>
						  The accumulation of knowledge led to the establishment of libraries,

						The more accessible information becomes, the more verification we need.
						<br>
						This issue is as old as our history itself.
						HERE you see the Malleus Maleficarum,
						also known as the "Hammer of Witches".
						This book is a stark example of the lack of scientific validation methods
						that existed during its publication.
						Originated in 1487, the book was an unscientific guide
						used during the period of the witch trials in Europe
						which established the justice framework for witchcraft.
						<br>
						This book was accepted largely based on social beliefs
						rather than empirical evidence.
						Today, it is even more important not to fall prey to unfounded assertions.
						After all, we certainly don't want to fuel our decisions with a "Hammer of Witches".

						In the current era, AI technologies like ChatGPT have emerged,

						All this takes the interaction with information to a new level.
						Here I want to emphasize that your native language almost is not important for the system anymore,
						because it simply understands and translates any language to the internal representation!

						The fact is that nowadays any information is extremely accessible!
						Even without an AI assistant, one has access to a massive amount of information.
						<br>
						For example, on YouTube, you can find an explanation for almost anything and to solve
						almost any problem, from repairing not working washing machine
						to executing the proper professional technique for a squat exercise, as we see here on the slide.
						<br>
						Moreover, often, you can not only watch the video, but interact with the information,
						change some features and learn by exploration.
						With modern tools, you can even create similar materials yourself.
						<br>
						For instance, using Universe Sandbox application, you can literally make planet Mars collide
						with planet Venus and see the result.
						This simulates modern scientific theories about the world
						and displays all the physics of the process on your screen within a few minutes.
						Moreover, I am sure there is already, or definitely soon will be, a similar application
						for any scientific area.

						Ok, and we go on!
						<br>
						And the next huge thing is that modern AI assistants not only search for facts and information,
						but they also combine and even generate it successfully.
						We might even say that they generate a kind of new, original content.
						Partly, it is true even for these slides.
						<br>
						So we get an enormous amount of information, and the challenge is that
						we don't know at all whether it is true.
						Here we encounter a fundamental problem: is it possible to somehow verify the answers of assistant,
						that might be smarter than we are =)
						Or maybe we can at least align it with our goals and work together effectively?
						In fact this question is most relevant for education,
						how we can use modern technologies safely and for the benefit there?

						Now let's move on to the second part of the talk and let's discuss the influence
						of ChatGPT in education.<br>
						We start with the example of CHEGG company, which focused on improving learning
						and learning outcomes for students. This company, as many others,
						was hit hard by the launch of ChatGPT.
						<br>
						In May 2023, the company said, “In the FIRST PART of the year,
						we saw no noticeable impact from ChatGPT on our new account growth, and
						we were meeting expectations on new sign-ups.”
						<br>
						But students that paid Chegg to practice exams and get homework feedback turned to ChatGPT instead.
						As a result, the company share price decreased more than 40%.
						In August 2023 the company already said, “We’ve pivoted the company to harness AI to better serve learners.”
						Now they are building internal LLM in partnership with Scale AI.

									<br><br><br></em>
									</div>
								</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						And of course, students master new technologies just as well as you and I or even better.
						<br>
						Consider two typical examples from students of our educational program in Cyprus.
						NADEZHDA with her friends had one exam in the format of solving practical cases.
						They had to prepare using only two task samples from the teacher.
						So they added the theory from the slides of all the lectures into the GPT,
						followed it with exam samples. And asked AI to generate
						similar samples based on the received theory.
						It was a superfast preparation for this kind of exam!
						<br>
						Let's look at another example from YAROSLAV.
						He was given some task, to write some kind of convolutional neural network.
						Initially, when looking at such a task, it is not always clear how to approach
						it and where to start. In the past, Google solved this, helping with existing solutions
						and showing how related tasks are done.
						<br>
						Now ChatGPT just writes the first version of code.
						Usually, approximately 20% of this code remains in the final version of neural network;
						sometimes it writes completely inadequate code, which, however, helps to understand what to Google next.
						In the following process of execution, Yaroslav uses ChatGPT as a bug fixer.

						So what are the pros and cons of using ChatGPT in studying?
						<br>
						Let's begin with the USEFUL CASES.
						<br>
						It HELPS answer questions for tools with poor or inaccessible documentation
						(for example, it can tell you how to start using GNU Debugger).
						<br>
						It PROVIDES nice and quick examples for some JSONs and other objects,
						or some values to fill in the database.
						<br>
						ONE of the main points: it helps to overcome the fear of a “blank slate.”
						<br>
						And WHAT it doesn't handle well:
						<br>
						Definitely it is ANY TASK where you have a large general context of the whole project.
						<br>
						ALSO, it is non-typical problems in not so popular areas:
						if you ask to solve a dynamic programming problem in Haskell, it gives funny answers,
						which are totally wrong.
						<br>
						CRUCIAL for us: for different mathematical facts a lot of the GPT-generated proofs are incorrect.

						Let's switch gears and dive into my personal story and will try to think, if AI replace me?
						<br>
						I was born and raised in faraway snowy Novosibirsk in a beautiful Soviet family:
						mother is a doctor, father is an engineer, also I have an older brother.
						<br>
						Childhood in the 90s was fun: garages and new buildings as playground,
						the sea and the forest instilled a love of sports and tourism.
						In school, about the fifth grade I tried mathematics,
						already in the seventh I won the regional olympiad. It was almost a miracle.
						Away we go — a physics and mathematics school in the legendary AKADEMGORODOK,
						close to Obges (microdistrict), math at NSU, science...
						"You could not be a scientist, but a candidate must be!” as motto =)
						<br>
						In graduate school, I wanted to try something else.
						In parallel, the hype about machine learning grew,
						Yandex company wanted to come to Novosibirsk with the development office and,
						of course, School of data analysis (Yandex Data School).
						This chance could not be missed, and I was fortunate to simultaneously
						become a curator and student of the SHAD branch.
						It was truly difficult: I even took academic leave for the first time in my life.
						Before my graduation in the fourth semester,
						we had a daughter in our family, but I like everything and is happy :)
						I already worked as an analyst at Yandex for the graduation from Yandex Data School.
						<br>
						It was super-useful for about three years of experience in industrial programming and analytics,
						but I became increasingly aware that I was drawn back to teaching,
						science and organizing education.
						<br>
						So I moved to Saint Petersburg and started working as a head of
						the machine learning bachelor program in the new department of mathematics and
						computer science of St. Petersburg State University.
						It was such an educational startup within the University — a very strong team,
						support from Yandex, JetBrains, Gazprom Neft and other companies,
						many ambitious tasks and one big goal to create «MIT in Russia».
						<br>
						Now I am working here at JetBrains, developing a new bachelor program
						"Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence" with Neapolis University.
						<br>
						So here is intriguing question, can or when does AI replace me?
						<br>
						The researchers tested GPT-3.5, the previous best model of OpenAI,
						on reasoning problems found in intelligence tests and exams like the SAT.
						Notably, SAT is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States.
						It is a multiple-choice, pencil-and-paper test that measures a student's reading, writing, and math skills.
						Surprisingly, GPT-3.5 performed impressively well, solving 75% of the problems in SAT Math correctly.
						This outperformed the average score of human participants.
						<br>
						Notably, GPT-4v performed even better on its SATs. It scored 700 out of 800
						on the math portion. Personally I tested GPT-4v on some assignments of Yandex Data School,
						and it solved a lot of them successfully.
						<br>
						Anyway, I can still drive a car, understand people, and hope that it will help me pay the bills.

						FIRSTLY, there is a deliberate attempt to avoid copyright violation.
						This is an important consideration in today’s digital age.
						<br>
						NEXT, we must acknowledge that AI technology has not yet reached a point of complete reliability.
						This is crucial because over reliance on AI without proper verification
						can lead to significant issues in information security, protocol development, infrastructure,

						Let me switch gears and share my own workflow for teaching and lecture preparation.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, I usually work in PyCharm complemented with the TeXiFy IDEA plugin.
						This combination brings together LaTeX, Python, and JavaScript all in one place.
						It allows using powerful autocompletion and inspections of PyCharm,
						and inverse search from pdf.
						<br>
						NEXT, let's discuss the AI Assistant.
						It is capable of assisting with translations in a broader sense.
						AI helper is not just restricted to translating languages;
						it can convert formats, elaborate short ideas into detailed descriptions,
						and even to oral speech, facilitate auto tests creation, and more.
						<br>
						THIRDLY, I'm using the GitHub Copilot plugin.
						It offers practical pieces of code,
						draft solutions, and generally helps speed up the writing of text content
						for my instructions or lectures.
						<br>
						LAST but not least, the Grazie Pro plugin checks for typos and polishes long sentences.
						Its purpose is to ensure your text is clean, concise, and clear before reaching your audience.

				<section data-background-image="images/problem_to_IMC2024.gif">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here I'd like to show the concrete example from my own experience. It is producing
						the problem for the International Mathematical Competition.
						<br>
						First of all, I have chosen an appropriate problem from ancient times of my teaching
						at Novosibirsk State University. There I organized math contests with tricky olimpiad tasks.
						So I need to translate the problem from Russian to English and
						to make a Latex format from Microsoft Word.
						<br>
						You see, with the help of AI assistant; I can do it in a few seconds.
						Here I simply copy-paste the answer to the working area.
						Then I check the result and look at the Grazie suggestions.
						Here I don't accept it, because it suggests something strange
						about additional dot in the text after the word "elements",
						but often it helps to polish the text.
						<br>
						Then I compile Tex sources and look at PDF file.
						<br>
						Then I need to write a solution, so I think through the solution and type it in Latex format.
						So firstly, I write x^2 = 0, then latex Rightarrow command goes.
						Here you can see that GitHub Copilot helps me to write the solution very quickly;
						it even makes simple calculation with math formulas.
						<br>
						Then I write the second part of the solution. Here I need to prove that
						the product being equal to zero is commutative. So that ab=0 if and only if ba=0.
						You see, sometimes I disagree with the Copilot's suggestions, but often it helps.
						Eventually, I check everything, recompile Tex sources and get the final PDF file done.
						Really fast, effective and convenient workflow, at least for me.
						Maybe you will consider using something similar for your own practice.

						Let's go on to a few observations about modern education from our teachers.
						<br><br>
						They NOTED the incredible speed of learning today.
						Essentially, as soon as new knowledge emerges,
						it becomes almost immediately available to everyone.
						This speed makes a significant impact.
						<br>
						For instance, IMAGINE we discover something on Twitter today.
						By tomorrow, we've already added a new skill to our repertoire.
						In just a week, all of our students have acquired this skill.
						<br>
						That's why the CRUCIAL skill nowadays becomes the ability to solve unsolved problems.
						<br>
						ALSO our teachers highlighted certain essential activities
						for the development of critical thinking.
						<br>
						Those activities include crafting mathematical PROOFS,
						<br>
						DEBUGGING problems in code or systems,
						<br>
						tasks related to system ENGINEERING, including robotics,
						<br>
						and, importantly, engaging in HUMAN discussions and debates.
						<br>
						Each activity, in its own way, sharpens our ability to evaluate

						Here in the final part of the talk, let's look at
						the practical use-cases of AI that teachers are utilizing right now.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, AI can significantly streamline the creation of lecture materials.
						With a simple prompt, AI can help you generate a detailed lecture outline
						and even convert that outline into visually engaging slides using tools like reveal.js.
						This is a great example of how AI can facilitate the preparation process for educators.
						<br>
						NEXT, teachers are experimenting with AI's capabilities by checking the effectiveness
						of LLM in answering assignment questions.
						This not only tests the AI's understanding but also helps to identify
						how students might use such technology to aid their learning.
						<br>
						In the realm of ART and visuals, DALL-E 3 is another remarkable tool.
						It's capable of creating nice, high-quality illustrations,
						whether in raster or in vector formats.
						These illustrations can then be used to enhance teaching materials and engage students.
						<br>
						LASTLY, AI is taking on the task of handling routine responsibilities.
						From drafting course syllables to managing other repetitive tasks,
						AI is opening up space for teachers to focus on more personalized and creative aspects of their work.

						As we reach the final of the presentation, I'd like to leave you with some takeaways.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, the panorama of reliable information sources has evolved over the centuries.
						From the era of oral traditions to the digital age of AI, we have witnessed a monumental shift.
						Yet one constant remains — the need for critical thinking and verification.
						In today's fast-paced world, this need is not just constant but has become more crucial than ever.
						<br>
						SECONDLY, the incredible speed at which information is now accessible presents us
						with new opportunities.
						It allows for rapid learning, immediate access to knowledge,
						and the ability to connect globally.
						However, it also demands from us a heightened sense of discernment and responsibility.
						<br>
						As a COMPANY, addressing these changes means adapting and innovating.
						We already have 'JetBrains AI platform', integrated across all the products,
						improving our workflows and decision-making processes.
						<br>
						FINALLY, we don't just adapt but lead.
						We have the opportunity to be pioneers in integrating AI into education tools.
						By doing this, we can shape a smarter, more efficient learning environment.
						<br>
						So, I invite you to JOIN us in teaching and
						in development new learning environment; it's really fun and exciting.
						<br>
						Your thoughts, FEEDBACK, and ideas are invaluable.
						I encourage you to connect with me on Telegram, Slack or GitHub.
						Let's collaborate and shape the future of education together.
						Thank you.
