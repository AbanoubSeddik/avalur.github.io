						Hello everyone!
						I'm Alex Avdiushenko, and I am happy to have a talk here.
						Today we will discuss the key components of teaching Machine Learning.
  						First, let me briefly tell you that I am currently working on a computer science and
						artificial intelligence program at the JetBrains Academy and Neapolis University Pafos,
						where I also design and teach courses.
						We are glad to share our developments and thoughts with you, and ready for
						collaboration on different projects related to machine learning and programming, among other topics.
						<br>
						In the past, I worked as a developer at Yandex company, I was writing code and
						  developing machine learning models. Earlier in my career,
						  I was a research scientist and completed my Ph.D. in Math modeling.
						This is the kind of experience I bring to the table.

					<h3 style="text-align: left">1. Some examples of applying ML to modern problems</h3>
					<h3 style="text-align: left;color: darkgray">2. Practical aspects of creating ML course</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Essentially, my talk will consist of two parts.
						Firstly, we will discuss the philosophy of machine learning and how it influences our lives.

						Then, we will delve into the practical aspects of creating one-year machine learning course
						  and teaching it, including all the details.

						Let's start with an image that shows us the simple convolutional neural network,
						which is fascinating in its own right.
						We take an image, convert it into a set of pixels in computer memory,
						which can be represented by either three numbers for RGB format or even one number,
						the intensity of color for grayscale images.
						<br>
						We then process it as a matrix, performing simple matrix operations, such as multiplication.
						After these operations, the neural network model outputs a class label,
						identifying what is in the image — be it a bird, a dog, the sunset, or something else.
						The accuracy of these models is now so high that they not only outperform humans
						but also make all previous methods obsolete.
						This approach allows us to take an image and get an answer directly, using model as a black box.

					<p>And also LLama, Mistral, Grok…</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Moreover, these models can now handle a variety of tasks beyond just image classification.
						For example, they can translate text. You can provide a sentence, for example, in Greek language,
						and the model can translate it to English, and vice versa.
						The model "understands" what is required and performs the translation.
						This capability extends to answering hard questions in systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude3,
						making it possible to interact with machine learning models almost like with humans.
						<br>
						Also, there are many other models, like LLama, Mistral, Grok, and so on.

						We can guess that, for instance, autonomous vehicles are being developed
						and might replace human drivers in the future.
						THIS is an image of a real Hellenic autonomous vehicle in Cyprus.
						<br><br>
						Factories, like the one where TESLA cars are assembled, predominantly use robots,
						though humans are still involved in programming and maintenance.
						Almost all the work is done by machines, and humans manage the processes from the office.
						<br><br>
						Machine translation has ALSO advanced significantly.
						We all use translators on our phones or on the internet,
						and their quality is often comparable to or even better than human translators.
						<br>
						They allow easy translation of messages, emails, and even speech now,
						providing more than enough accuracy for everyday use.
						This development will definitely continue, bringing progress in many areas.

						There are many other examples of how machine learning and AI is improving our lives;

						Creating Machine Learning course from scratch is a challenging task.
						I tried to highlight some of the key aspects that are most clear and understandable for us.
						The rapid development we see in many fields is also happening in machine learning.
						If you take a modern course in biology, for example, you'll see that about one third of the material
						changes each year because science and progress keep advancing.
						<br>
						So we need to provide students with the most up-to-date knowledge,
						which means frequently updating our courses. For sure, this is also true for machine learning.
						<br>
						Last year, I had the opportunity to develop a new machine learning course from scratch
						at Neapolis University.
						I will talk mostly about this course, but suggest starting with a short intro.
						<br>
						One of the MOST popular courses in ML is Andrew Ng's course on Coursera.
						Many modern machine learning educators and researchers have grown up on this course.
						<br><br>
						ANOTHER course I know is the Open Data Science community's course, which is available on GitHub.
						It includes well-crafted lecture notes, theory descriptions in PDF format, and practical assignments.
						Everything is available for free, and nowadays, this is a common practice.
						<br>
						Of course, there are many other resources available,
						like the interactive TEXTBOOK "Dive into Deep Learning" by the big team of authors,
						mostly working at an Amazon company.
						Also, you can watch and code with VIDEO courses on YouTube.
						Such resources allow us to build a comprehensive course using a variety of materials.

					<aside class="notes">
						And how do you think, what is the main difficulty in teaching machine learning?
						It seems to me that we NEED to combine math theory and programming practice, and this is not easy.
						<br><br>
						To ensure success, the following STEPS are crucial:
						<br>
						1. You NEED to assemble a strong teaching team with both academic and industry experts
						to ensure students receive high-quality education and practical insights.
						<br>
						2. It IS crucial to have well-thought and resolved assignments.
						This is essential for mastering machine learning concepts.
						Students must practice coding and theoretical problems to reinforce their learning.
						<br>
						3. You NEED to establish trust and openness with students by engaging in
						regular conversations and addressing their concerns.
						<br>
						4. We NEED to create a competitive learning environment by
						incorporating contests like Kaggle competitions to motivate students.
						<br>
						5. Nowaday we MUST record and promptly upload lectures to accommodate different learning paces
						and ensure students who miss classes can catch up.
						<br>
						6. We NEED to foster an interactive and emotional learning atmosphere,
						even in online settings, by asking questions and encouraging participation.
						<br>
						In conclusion, it's important to maintain an open and accessible teaching environment.

						In our Machine Learning course at Neapolis University
						students write their code for different ML algorithms
						to understand the inner details deeply.
						The course also includes theoretical and practical tasks and culminates in an exam
						consisting of six problems for three hours to assess the students' understanding.
						<br><br>
						One-year course consists of two parts. The FIRST part covers the fundamentals of machine learning,
						including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, neural networks, and building GPT-2 from scratch.
						<br><br>
						The SECOND part delves into advanced machine learning topics like clustering,
						tokenization, building AlphaZero from scratch,
						and generative and discriminative models like Variational Auto Encoders,
						Generative Adversarial Networks, and Retrival Augmented Generation.
						<br><br>
						To address the question about course updates:
						indeed, each year, the course needs to be revised by at least one third.
						This is challenging for educators who recently developed the course and
						would prefer to reuse much of the content.
						While it might be possible to retain the same content in the second year,
						by the third year, significant changes are almost always necessary.
						<br>
						To manage this, we assess which lectures need modification, which should be removed,
						and which new material should be added.
						Our course structure is limited to 13 lectures, so adding new material means removing some of the old.
						This limitation helps us maintain a manageable course size.

						Assignments are a crucial part of the course, and we have a variety of them.
						<br>
						To address the issue of assessing criteria at the beginning of a course:
						we set clear and fixed points for each assignment in advance. While the criteria for getting
						specific grades might be adjusted based on initial feedback and performance,
						the overall structure remains constant.
						Generally, achieving a passing grade is relatively straightforward,
						requiring about half of the total points.
						This ensures that students who complete the assignments diligently can pass,
						while higher grades require more comprehensive work.
						<br><br>
						In the FIRST part, we have about six or seven assignments.
						The first one is about mastering NumPy and Pandas.
						Then we move on to the theory of linear models and studying ML via practical projects.
						<br>
						Also, we have two competitions as a valuable tool for motivation.
						Public leaderboards are used cautiously to encourage
						a healthy competitive spirit without discouraging students.
						<br><br>
						In the SECOND part of the course, students have four assignments and final project.
						We try to make the assignments as practical and as up to date as possible,
						so students can apply their knowledge to real-world problems, such as implementing
						a minimal version of LLama or creating your own voice assistant Jarvis to talk with.
						At the end of the course, students present their final project and write a blog post about it.

					<h3 style="text-align: left">My setup for online teaching in 2024</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Slides in <span class="important">JavaScript (reveal.js):</span> for animations, video and interactivity</li>
						<li class="fragment">Formulas and hand drew pictures in <span class="important">Notability on iPad</span></li>
						<li class="fragment"><span class="important">PyCharm and Jupyter notebooks</span> for coding demos</li>
					</ul>
					<br><br>
					<p class="fragment" style="text-align: left"><span class="important">OBS Studio</span> for combining
						different scenes and streaming it</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now I'd like to share with you my own setup for online teaching in 2024.
						Let's go through components step by step.
						<br><br>
						FIRST, as you see now, I used to make slides in JavaScript using Reveal.js framework.
						This tool is great for creating dynamic and interactive presentations.
						With Reveal.js, you can incorporate animations, embed videos,
						and add interactivity to keep students engaged.
						<br><br>
						NEXT, for formulas and hand-drawn pictures,
						I use Notability app on iPad. This combination allows for real-time,
						intuitive drawing and writing, which is particularly useful for explaining complex concepts
						and equations in a visually accessible manner.
						<br><br>
						For CODING demonstrations, I prefer to turn to PyCharm and Jupyter Notebooks.
						PyCharm is an excellent IDE for Python, offering robust coding support and debugging tools.
						Jupyter Notebooks are perfect for interactive coding sessions,
						where you can show live code execution and visualizations.
						<br><br>
						FINALLY, to bring everything together, you may use Open Broadcast Software Studio.
						It is a powerful tool for combining different scenes, such as your
						slides, whiteboard, and coding environment, into a seamless streaming experience.
						<br>
						This setup not only enhances the visual quality of your lectures
						but also allows you to switch between different teaching materials smoothly.
						<br>
						Now let me show how it works in practice.
						You see, I can switch between slides and whiteboard with one click.
						<br>
						Then I can explain the formula of one linear neuron in real time.
						Also, I can show and comment, adding hand-drawn pictures,
						the matrix multiplication method and so on.
						Any complex topic can be explained naturally in this way.
						And of course I can switch to PyCharm with any code
						and show how to implement everything in Python from scratch.

						You may ask what about teaching routine automatization?
						Unfortunately, I have bad news for you =)

						Now in the conclusion, I suggest discussing motivation for education in Machine Learning (ML).
						<br><br>
						To my opinion, Artificial Intelligence is NOW should be considered as the third form of literacy,
						aligning itself right after classical literacy and programming skills.
						This emphasizes its importance and relevance in the modern technological era.
						<br><br>
						MOREOVER, machine learning disrupts various fields at an unprecedented rate.
						Particularly in the areas of cutting-edge science and business.
						<br><br>
						Also, since the year 2024, the significance of AI has been underscored even further by
						the start of the International Olympiad in AI for school students.
						To learn more about this nice initiative, you can visit their website shown on this slide.
						<br><br>
						Finally, it's worth mentioning that the process of teaching and
						studying Machine Learning is enjoyable and fascinating!

						So, the dynamic field of Machine Learning is not just an academic or professional requirement,
						but also fits for intellectual enjoyment and technological advancement.
						<br><br>
						THANK you for your attention! Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or comments.
