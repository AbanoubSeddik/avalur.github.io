						Hello everyone!
						I'm Alex Avdiushenko, and I am happy to have a talk here.
						Today we will discuss the key components of teaching Machine Learning.
  						First, let me briefly tell you that I am currently working on a computer science and
						artificial intelligence program at Neapolis University in Pafos and at JetBrains company,
						where I also design and teach courses.
						We are always glad to share our ideas and thoughts with you and ready for
						collaboration on different projects related to machine learning and programming, among other topics.
						<br>
						In the past, I worked as a developer at a Yandex company,
						  I was writing code and developing machine learning models.
						  Earlier in my career,
						  I was a research scientist and completed my Ph.D. in Math modeling.
						  This is the kind of experience I bring to the table.

					<h3 style="text-align: left">1. Some examples of applying AI to modern problems</h3>
					<h3 style="text-align: left;color: darkgray">2. Practical aspects of creating ML course</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ok, let's go on to the essence of the talk. It will consist of two parts.
						Firstly, we will discuss the philosophy of machine learning and how it influences our lives.

						Then, we will delve into the practical aspects of creating one-year machine learning course
						  and teaching it, including all the details.

					<aside class="notes">
						Let's start with an image that shows us the simple convolutional neural network,
						which is fascinating in its own right.
						So we take an image, convert it into a set of pixels in computer memory,
						which can be represented by either three numbers for RGB format or even one number,
						the intensity of color for grayscale images.
						<br>
						We then process it as a matrix, performing simple matrix operations, such as multiplication.
						After these operations, the neural network model outputs a class label,
						identifying what is in the image — be it a bird, a dog, the sunset, or something else.
						The accuracy of these models is now so high that they not only outperform humans
						but also make all previous methods obsolete.
						This approach allows us to take an image and get an answer directly, using model as a black box.

					<p class="fragment">And also LLama, Mistral, Grok…</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Moreover, these models can now handle a variety of tasks beyond just image classification.
						For example, they can translate text. You can provide a sentence, let's say,
						in the Greek language, and the model can translate it to English, and vice versa.
						The model "understands" what is required and performs the translation.
						<br>
						For sure, you have heard ABOUT the GPT-4 model from OpenAI company,
						which for a long time was the smartest of all.
						<br>
						Now, OpenAI HAS released GPT-4o1 model, which is even more advanced!
						It is capable of generating text, code, and even answering hard questions.
						<br>
						Gemini from GOOGLE is another model that can do almost the same and has a really large size of context.
						<br>
						Another competitor in this field is Claude3, which now often is used with Cursor editor
						to develop software applications ten times faster.
						<br>
						Also, there are many other models, like LLama, Mistral, Grok, and so on.

						We can guess that, for instance, autonomous vehicles are being developed
						and might replace human drivers in the future.
						THIS is an image of a real Hellenic autonomous vehicle in Cyprus.
						<br><br>
						Factories, like the one where TESLA cars are assembled, predominantly use robots,
						though humans are still involved in programming and maintenance.
						Almost all the work is done by machines, and humans manage the processes from the office.
						<br><br>
						Of course, machine translation has ALSO advanced significantly.
						We all use translators on our phones or on the internet,
						and their quality is often comparable to or even better than human translators.
						<br>
						They allow easy translation of messages, emails, and even speech now,
						providing more than enough accuracy for everyday use.
						This development will definitely continue, bringing progress to many areas.

					<aside class="notes">
						That's why I offer to move on.
						You may ask what about teaching routine automatization?
						And unfortunately, I have bad news for you =)
						<br>
						Despite the rapid development of AI assistants and other systems,
						which now are capable of generating text, code, but
						the teaching routine is not yet fully automated.

						<br><br>
						It CANNOT create interesting, well-thought, and detailed homework assignments.
						<br><br>
						It even CANNOT check the students' code and provide feedback.
						<br><br>
						It seems to me that the ONLY way of using such technology in teaching

					<h3>Motivation for teaching (and studying) ML</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">AI now is <span class="important">third literacy</span>, after classical literacy and programming</li>
						<li class="fragment">Machine learning is becoming more and more common everywhere,
							including in <span class="important">cutting-edge science and business</span></li>
						<li class="fragment">Since 2024, there is even International Olympiad in AI for school students:
							<a href="https://ioai-official.org" style="color: mediumblue;text-decoration: underline">IOAI</a></li>
						<li class="fragment">The opportunity to deeply understand the material that you are teaching 😁</li>
						<li class="fragment">And, of course, it is <span class="important">fun</span> to teach and study ML!</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now I suggest discussing a very important topic, maybe the most important =)
						It is motivation for education in Machine Learning.
						<br><br>
						So this is the first reason. In my opinion, Artificial Intelligence NOW should be considered as the third form of literacy,
						aligning itself right after classical literacy and programming skills.
						<br><br>
						MOREOVER, machine learning disrupts various fields at an impressive pace.
						Particularly in the areas of cutting-edge science and business.
						<br><br>
						Also, since 2024, the significance of AI has been underscored even more by
						the start of the International Olympiad in AI for school students.
						To learn more about this nice initiative, you can visit their website shown on this slide.
						<br><br>
						Another possible REASON, fairly speaking, one of the main ones for me,
						is the opportunity to deeply understand the material that you are telling.
						<br><br>
						Finally, it's worth mentioning that the process of teaching and
						studying Machine Learning is enjoyable and fascinating!

					<aside class="notes">
						Now let's pause for a couple of minutes here before the second part of the talk.

					<h3>Creating a Machine Learning course from scratch</h3>

					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						So, creating a Machine Learning COURSE from scratch is a challenging task.
						I tried to highlight some of the key aspects that are most clear and understandable for us.
						<br>
						The RAPID development we see in many fields is also happening in machine learning.
						<br>
						If you take a modern course in BIOLOGY, for example, you'll see that about one third of the material
						changes each year because science and progress keep advancing.
						<br>
						So we need to provide students with the most up-to-date knowledge,
						which means frequently UPDATING our courses. For sure, this is also true for machine learning.
						<br>
						Last year, I had the opportunity to develop a new machine learning course from scratch
						at Neapolis University.
						I will talk mostly about this course,
						but suggest starting with a short survey of other possibilities.

					<aside class="notes">
						One of the most popular courses in ML is Andrew Ng's course on Coursera.
						Many modern machine learning educators and researchers have grown up on this course.
						<br><br>
						ANOTHER course I know is the Open Data Science community's course, which is available on GitHub.
						It includes well-crafted lecture notes, theory descriptions in PDF format, and practical assignments.
						Everything is available for free, and nowadays, this is a common practice.
						<br>
						Of course, there are many other resources available,
						like the interactive TEXTBOOK "Dive into Deep Learning" by the big team of authors,
						mostly working at an Amazon company.
						<br>
						Also, you can watch and code with VIDEO courses on YouTube.
						Such resources allow us to build a comprehensive course using a variety of materials.

					<aside class="notes">
						And how do you think, what is the main difficulty in teaching machine learning?
						It seems to me that we NEED to combine math theory and programming practice,
						and this is not an easy task.
						<br><br>
						To ensure success, the following STEPS are crucial:
						<br>
						1. You NEED to assemble a strong teaching team with both academic and industry experts
						to ensure students receive high-quality education and practical insights.
						<br>
						2. It IS crucial to have well-thought and resolved assignments.
						This is essential for mastering machine learning concepts.
						<br>
						3. You NEED to establish trust and openness with students by engaging in
						regular conversations and addressing their concerns.
						<br>
						4. We NEED to create a competitive learning environment, for example, by
						incorporating contests like Kaggle competitions to motivate students.
						<br>
						5. Nowadays, we MUST record and promptly upload lectures to accommodate different learning paces
						and ensure students who miss classes can catch up.
						<br>
						6. We NEED to foster an interactive and emotional atmosphere,
						even in online settings, by asking questions and encouraging participation.
						<br>
						In conclusion, it's important to maintain an open and accessible teaching environment.

					<aside class="notes">
						In our Machine Learning course at Neapolis University
						students write their code for different machine learning algorithms
						to understand the inner details deeply.
						The course also includes theoretical and practical tasks and culminates in an exam
						consisting of six problems for three hours.
						<br><br>
						The whole one-year course consists of two parts. The FIRST part covers
						the fundamentals of machine learning,
						including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, neural networks,
						and even building GPT-2 from scratch.
						<br><br>
						The SECOND part delves into advanced machine learning topics like clustering,
						tokenization, building AlphaZero from scratch,
						and generative and discriminative models like Variational Auto Encoders,
						Generative Adversarial Networks, and Retrieval Augmented Generation.
						<br><br>
						To address the question about course UPDATES:
						indeed, each year, the course needs to be revised by at least one third.
						While it might be possible to retain the same content in the second year,
						by the third year, significant changes are almost always necessary.
						<br>
						Our course structure is limited to 13 lectures, so adding new material means
						removing some of the old.
						This limitation helps us maintain a manageable course size.

					<aside class="notes">
						Assignments are the crucial part of the course, and we have a variety of them.
						<br><br>
						In the FIRST part, we have about six or seven assignments.
						The first one is about mastering NumPy and Pandas.
						Then we move on to the theory of linear models and studying ML with practical projects.
						<br>
						Also, we have two competitions as a valuable tool for motivation.
						Public leaderboards are used to encourage
						a healthy competitive spirit without discouraging students.
						<br><br>
						In the SECOND part of the course, students have four assignments and a final project.
						We try to make the assignments as practical and as up-to-date as possible.
						So students can apply their knowledge to real-world problems, such as implementing
						a minimal version of LLama or creating your own voice assistant Jarvis to talk with on your own laptop.
						At the end of the course, students present their final project and write a blog post about it.
						It is also an important part of education, which can be used as an advertisement for the student.
						<br><br>
						To address the issue of assessing criteria:
						at the beginning of a course we set clear and fixed points for each assignment in advance.
						Generally, achieving a passing grade is relatively straightforward,
						requiring about HALF of the total points.
						This ensures that students who complete the assignments diligently, can pass,
						while higher grades require more comprehensive work.
						Sometimes we need to slightly adjust our grading system at the end of the course.

						Firstly, we use the JetBrains Marketplace for all code assignments.
						This platform is convenient because it integrates with the JetBrains IDEs,
						allowing students to complete assignments directly in the IDE and submit them with one click.

						Ok, the second platform we use only for competitions is the Kaggle platform.
						It is well-known in the machine learning community and
						provides a great environment for hosting competitions and datasets.
						<br>
						As I have said before, the Cogniterra provides a unified interface for managing assignments,
						grading, and providing feedback to students.
						<br>
						Also, of course, we use GitHub for the final project assignment,
						where students can submit their projects.
						<br>
						Overall, this zoo of platforms covers our needs and
						makes it good enough for both students and instructors.

					<aside class="notes">
						Now I'd like to share with you my own setup for online teaching in 2024.
						Let's go through components step by step.
						<br><br>
						FIRST, as you see here in these slides, I used to make them in JavaScript with Reveal.js framework.
						This tool is great for creating dynamic and interactive presentations.
						<br><br>
						NEXT, for formulas and hand-drawn pictures,
						I use Notability app on iPad. This combination allows for real-time,
						intuitive drawing and writing, which is particularly useful for explaining complex concepts.

						Now let me show a live demo of how this works.
						You see, I can switch between slides and whiteboard with one click.
						<br><br>
						For CODING demonstrations, I prefer to turn to PyCharm and Jupyter Notebooks inside PyCharm.
						PyCharm is an excellent IDE for Python, which offers great coding support, autocompletion
						and debugging tools.
						<br><br>
						FINALLY, to bring everything together, I prefer using Open Broadcast Software Studio.
						It is a powerful tool for combining different scenes, such as your
						slides, whiteboard, and coding environment.
						<br>
						This setup not only enhances the visual quality of your lectures
						but also allows you to switch between different teaching materials smoothly.
						<br><br>
						Any complex topic can be explained naturally in this way.
						And of course I can switch to any material and explain it.
