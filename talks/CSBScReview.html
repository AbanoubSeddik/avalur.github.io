						<h3 style="text-align: left">Important note</h3>
						<p style="text-align: left" class="fragment">In many ways, <span class="important">Supervision</span>
							is a substitute for checking weekly assignments.
							And often there are only exams in core subjects at the end of the first year.</p>

						<p style="text-align: left" class="fragment">
							For instance, at <span class="important">Oxford</span>
							the first year is really special.
						    Students have to pass 4 combined exams in 9 subjects to get into the second year of study.
							Exams happen at the end of the year (not the semester):</p>

						<ol class="fragment">
							<li>Functional Programming, Design and Analysis of Algorithms</li>
							<li>Imperative Programming</li>
							<li>Discrete Mathematics, Probability, and Continuous Mathematics</li>
							<li>Digital Systems, Linear Algebra and Introduction to Formal Proof</li>
						</ol>

						<aside class="notes">
							Let's go on, and here I want to emphasize the importance of Supervision.
							<br>
							In some universities, Supervision serves as a substitute for the traditional method of weekly assignment checking.
							Instead of regular assessments, students often only face exams in their core subjects at the end of the first year.
							<br>
							For example, at Oxford, the first year is exceptionally rigorous.
							Students must pass four combined exams covering nine subjects to progress to the second year.
							These exams are held at the end of the year, rather than each semester.
							<br>
							Here are the subjects included in these exams:
							1. Functional Programming, and Design and Analysis of Algorithms
							2. Imperative Programming
							3. Discrete Mathematics, Probability, and Continuous Mathematics
							4. Digital Systems, Linear Algebra, and Introduction to Formal Proof

							This system ensures that students have a comprehensive understanding of each subject before they are tested,
							allowing for a more in-depth and integrated learning experience.

						<h3 style="text-align: left">Types of practical projects for the students</h3>
						<ul class="custom-list">
							<li class="fragment lamp">Individual project ‚Äî maybe part of the course (UCL, Oxford)</li>
							<li class="fragment lamp">Group project ‚Äî often from industry partner (TUM, Ecole, Oxford, Delft)</li>
							<li class="fragment lamp">Research project ‚Äî usually the result is Thesis (all, except Ecole)</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Let's discuss the types of practical projects that students can engage in during their studies.
							<br>
							Firstly, we have **Individual Projects**. These are often integrated into the course curriculum and
							allow students to apply the concepts they've learned in a more focused and personalized manner.
							Universities like UCL and Oxford frequently incorporate individual projects into their courses.
							<br>
							Next, there are **Group Projects**. These projects are typically collaborative efforts,
							often involving partnerships with industry.
							They provide students with the opportunity to work in teams, simulating real-world scenarios
							and fostering skills in teamwork and communication.
							Institutions such as TUM, Ecole Polytechnique, Oxford, and Delft are known
							for facilitating group projects, often with input from industry partners.
							<br>
							Lastly, we have **Research Projects**. These projects usually culminate in a thesis
							and are mandatory in most universities, except for Ecole Polytechnique.
							Research projects are critical for students interested in deepening their knowledge
							and contributing original findings to their field of study.
							<br>
							Each type of project offers unique benefits and learning experiences,
							ensuring that students are well-prepared for their future careers, whether in academia, industry, or research.

						Finally, let's dive into some of the hotly debated topics in the field of computer science education.
						These are often referred to as 'holy war' topics because of the strong opinions they evoke.
						<br>
						Firstly, we have the question: **How much math is necessary for a bachelor's degree in computer science?**
						Should it be limited to around 3 courses, or should it be as many as 10 out of a total of 30?
						This debate centers around the balance between theoretical knowledge and practical skills.
						Some argue that a strong foundation in mathematics is essential for understanding complex algorithms and systems,
						while others believe that too much emphasis on math can detract from the hands-on learning of programming and software development.
						<br>
						Secondly, there's the discussion on whether **we need to teach students teamwork, ethics, and soft skills in dedicated courses**.
						In the tech industry, collaboration and ethical considerations are increasingly important.
						However, integrating these soft skills into a curriculum traditionally focused on technical abilities remains controversial.
						Should these skills be taught as separate courses, or should they be embedded within technical courses?
						<br>
						Lastly, we contemplate the **ideal portrait of a graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science**.
						What attributes and skills should they possess? This touches on both the depth and breadth of knowledge,
						the balance between theoretical and practical skills, and the importance of personal and professional development.
						<br>
						Thank you for your attention. I'm open to any further questions.
