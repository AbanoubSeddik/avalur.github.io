					<aside class="notes">
						Welcome to the JetBrains Academy AI Festival,
						a gathering of minds eager to explore the frontiers of artificial intelligence in education.
						We're thrilled to have you join us for this innovative event.
						Lets' transform how we learn and teach, embark on this journey together
						and see where this path takes us!

						Take a look at our two main tracks for the festival.
						Track 1, 'Solo Mastery,' is a Kaggle-style individual competition
						where you'll be tasked with processing source code to extract key information.
						Details are announced on Discord,
						and there's no limit on the number of participants.
						So if you're up for the challenge, give it a try!
						<br>
						Moving on to Track 2, 'The Power of the Team,' we invite you to form teams of up to six people.
						This is your chance to assemble your dream team and create
						an AI companion that will transform the student learning experience.

						In Track 2, we challenge you to push the boundaries of collaborative innovation.
						Your task is to create a universal AI assistant that helps students not just solve,
						but truly understand educational programming tasks.
						This AI won't just give away the answers but will guide students through
						the problem-solving process with intelligent hints.
						<br>
						Remember, we're not prescribing a rigid set of functionalities.
						Your teams are encouraged to think outside the box,
						to be as innovative as possible within the educational context.
						It's all about enhancing learning while fostering creativity.

						To support your development, we're providing an array of resources.
						You'll have access to our education course complete with problems,
						correct solutions, and tests, students' solutions for insights,
						and the powerful Grazie API for language tools.
						<br>
						Your AI assistant should operate on a simple yet effective principle.
						When a student encounters an error in their code,
						whether it's during execution or an incorrect solution,
						your AI will step in to offer hints and nudge them in the right direction.
						It's about empowering students to learn from their mistakes and improve their coding skills.

						Winners will be determined by a jury that evaluates the AI assistants on test data,

						The format of your AI assistant can vary from a console application to a web,
						desktop, or mobile application.
						The choice is yours, as long as it effectively meets the project goals.

						<div class="typesetting">
						<p style="text-align: left">
							By the designated deadline <span style="color: orange">(March 3, 6:00 PM)</span>,
							your team is required to submit your project's progress by uploading
							it to a publicly accessible repository, as well as recording a video presentation.
							Aim to vividly and completely describe and demonstrate all of your ideas in the video,
							including both those you have managed to implement and those you were unable to complete.
							Including a README file in your project repository to guide users through
							the project setup process is highly recommended.
							The video presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes.
							<br><br>
							The links to both the repository and the video presentation will be collected through
							<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRg96OP0Ej8bkCJWASSnj4frVRwzyKtdHUX-x0InrGYoix0A/viewform">

						(As submission details appear)
						<br>
						As we near the project submission deadline on March 3rd,
						remember to upload your progress to a publicly accessible repository
						and record a concise video presentation of your work.
						This is your chance to showcase not only what you've achieved but also
						the full scope of your vision for the project.
						A detailed README and a clear demonstration in your video will be key.
						<br>
						Submit your links through the provided Google Forms link,
						and let's ensure we all keep to the spirit of hard work and kindness throughout this festival.
						<br>
						(End with a positive note)
						<br>
						Best of luck to all participants!
						Let's make this JB Academy AI Festival a memorable event full of learning,
						innovation, and collaboration.
						Work hard, be creative, and most importantly, let's be nice
						and support each other in this exciting endeavor. Thank you!
