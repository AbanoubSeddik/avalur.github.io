						Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr Avdiushenko, I am very happy to have a talk on
		   				  the conference and today we will discuss the evolution of education and
						  its interconnection with technology.

						  Let's start with the brief history of human education and knowledge sharing development.
						  <br><br>
						  1. Oral Tradition is about 3 thousand Before Christ's Birth:
						  In the earliest days of human civilization, knowledge was transferred
						  orally from generation to generation.
						  Storytelling, folklore, and hands-on experiences were the primary methods for education.
						  <br>
						  So, oral speech is reliable!

					  <aside class="notes">
						  2. Birth of Writing and Numeracy (circa 3,200 BCE):
						  <br><br>
						  Around 5,200 years ago, in ancient Mesopotamia, the first known writing system, cuneiform, was developed.
						  This was closely tied with the invention of numbers and basic arithmetic,
						  which allowed for record-keeping and administration of transactions, mostly in marketplaces.
						  <br>
						  Naturally, then, first of all, there were needed convenient notations and
						  the ability to accumulate knowledge. Fun things to know about this piece of history is
						  that first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credits
						  long precede the invention of money.
						  <br>
						  Well, clay tablets are reliable!

					<aside class="notes">
						It is interesting and well-known, that cuneiform numerical notation was base sixty,
						unlike our base 10 numbers, but they had a true place value system like we do, not like
						Roman numerals for example.

						  3. Scrolls and Libraries (circa 1200 BCE — 15th Century CE):
						  <br>
						  The accumulation of knowledge led to the establishment of libraries,
						  such as the famous Library of Alexandria.
						  Scrolls made of papyrus or parchment were the primary means of storing and sharing information.
						  <br>
						  Well, papyrus is reliable!

						  With the advent of electricity, technologies like the telegraph and telephone emerged,
						  allowing for real-time communication over long distances.
						  This made the sharing of information quicker and more efficient.
						  <br>
						  The internet boom of the time was telegraph. It came into commercial use by 1840, submarine
						  cables were laid by 1850. This allowed rapid communication between continents for
						  the first time ever.

						7. Artificial Intelligence and ChatGPT (21st Century CE):<br>
						In the current era, AI technologies like ChatGPT have emerged,
						providing personalized and interactive learning experiences.
						<br>
						These technologies engage users in conversations, answer queries, and aid in learning,
						taking the interaction with information to a new level.
						<br>
						But is ChatGPT reliable? We will discuss it later.

					<aside class="notes">
						The fact is that nowadays any information is extremely accessile!
						Even without AI assistant one has massive amount of information.<br>
						For example, on Youtube you can find nice explanation of everything and to solve
						almost any problem from either repairing not working washing machine
						or how to perform the right professional technic of squat exercise.

						Often you can not only watch the video, but interact with the information,
						to change some characteristics and to learn by exploration.
						With modern tools you can even create similar materials yourself.
						<br>
						For instance, using Universe Sandbox application, you can literally push Mars with Venus and
						look at the result, which will repeat modern scientific ideas about the world
						and show all the physics of the process in a few minutes on your screen.
						Moreover, I am sure there is or definitely soon will be similar application
						for any scientific area.
					</aside>

				<section data-background-image="images/robot_generates.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						But the next huge thing is, that modern AI assistants not only search the facts and information,
						they generate it successfully. We might say it generates new original content.
						<br>
						So we get enormous amount of information and the challenge is, that we don't know if it is true or not.
						Here we got fundamental problem: is it possible to verify the system, that probably is smarter, then we are =)
						Maybe at least align it with our goals and work together effectively.

					<aside class="notes">
						Chegg, an NYSE-listed company focused on improving learning and learning outcomes for students,
						was hit hard by the launch of ChatGPT.
						<br>
						In May 2023, the company said “In the first part of the year,
						we saw no noticeable impact from ChatGPT on our new account growth and
						we were meeting expectations on new sign-ups.”
						<br>
						Students that paid Chegg to practice exams and get homework feedback turned to ChatGPT instead.
						As a result, their share price plummeted >40%.
						In Chegg’s August 2023 earnings call,
						the company said “We’ve pivoted the company to harness AI to better serve learners.”
						Now they’re building internal LLMs in partnership with Scale AI.

						And of course, students master new technologies just as well as you and I.
						<br>
						Consider two typical examples. Nadezhda with her friends had one exam in the format of solving practical cases.
						They had to prepare using only two task samples from the teacher.
						So they added the theory from the slides of all the lectures into the GPT,
						followed it with exam samples and asked it to generate similar tasks and answers to them based on the received theory.
						It was super fast preparation for this kind of exams!</em>

						Look to the another example from Yaroslav. He was given some task,
						to write some kind of convolutional neural network for something.
						Initially, when looking at such a task, it is not always clear how to approach it and where to start.
						In the past, this was solved by Google — just Google existing solutions, see how related tasks are done.
						<br>
						Usually 10-30 percent of this code remains by the time of the final version;
						sometimes it writes completely inadequate code, which, however, helps to understand what to Google next.
						In the further process of execution Yaroslav use it as a bug fixer —
						it is not always possible to understand what the error is.
						You can throw the code into it and ask it to find and fix the error.
						Often the solutions it proposes are not workable, but lead to the author’s solution to the problem.
