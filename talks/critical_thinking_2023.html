						Hello everyone!
						I'm Aleksandr Avdiushenko, and I am thrilled to have a talk at the conference.
						Today we will discuss the evolution of education and its interconnection with technology.

						Essentially the talk will consist of two parts:
						  one is more historical and philosophical, and the second is more practical and useful, I hope.

						  Let's start with the brief history of human education and knowledge sharing development.
						  <br>
						  So THE FIRST STOP of our journey is oral tradition.
						  It was the only way of sharing knowledge about three thousand Before Christ's Era:
						  In the earliest days of human civilization, information was transferred
						  orally from generation to generation.
						  Storytelling, folklore, and hands-on experiences were
						  the primary and the only methods for education.
						  <br>
						  So, oral speech is reliable!

					  <aside class="notes">
						  Let's go on!
						  <br><br>
						  Around five thousand years ago, in ancient Mesopotamía,
						  the first known writing system, cuneiform, was developed.
						  This was closely tied with the invention of numbers and basic arithmetic,
						  which allowed for record-keeping and administration of transactions, mostly in marketplaces.
						  <br>
						  First of all, there were needed convenient notations and the ability to accumulate knowledge.
						  Fun thing to know about this piece of history is
						  that the first forms of writing were about accounting and credits
						  long precede the invention of money.
						  <br>
						  Well, clay tablets are reliable!

					<aside class="notes">
						It is also interesting and quite well-known that cuneiform numerical notation was base sixty,
						unlike our base ten numbers, but they had a true place value system like we do, not like
						Roman numerals, for example. So the position of each digit within a number determines its value.

						  Ok, now we move on to the third stage, which was connected with Scrolls and Libraries.
						  <br>
						  The accumulation of knowledge led to the establishment of libraries,

						</div>
					</div>
					<aside class="notes">
						The more accessible information becomes, the more verification we need.
						<br>
						This issue is as old as our history itself.
						HERE you see the Malleus Maleficarum, also known as the "Hexenhammer" or the "Hammer of Witches".
						This book is a stark example of the lack of scientific validation methods
						that existed during its publication.
						Originated in 1487, the "Hammer of Witches" was an unscientific guide
						used during the period of the witch trials in Europe
						which established the justice framework for witchcraft.
						<br>
						This book was accepted largely based on societal beliefs rather than empirical evidence.
						For us, it serves as a reminder of the danger of failing
						to substantiate claims with sound scientific practice.
						Today in our data-driven society, it is ever so vital to reiterate
						the importance of the verification problem and the due diligence needed,
						in order not to fall prey to unfounded assertions.
						After all, we certainly don't want to fuel our decisions with a "Hammer of Witches", do we?

						  Here we are close to modern time: the second half of the 20th century saw
						  the rise of computers and the Internet.

						In the current era, AI technologies like ChatGPT have emerged,

						<br>
						These technologies engage users in conversations, answer all your questions,
						and help in learning,
						taking the interaction with information to a new level.
						Here I need to emphasize that your language almost is not important for the system anymore,
						because it simply understands and translates any language to the internal representation!

					<h2>Information is extremely accessible!</h2>

							allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<aside class="notes">
						The fact is that nowadays any information is extremely accessible!
						Even without an AI assistant, one has access to a massive amount of information.<br>
						For example, on YouTube, you can find an explanation for almost anything and to solve
						almost any problem, from repairing not working washing machine
						to executing the proper professional technique for a squat exercise, as we see here on slide.
						<br>
						Moreover, often, you can not only watch the video, but interact with the information,
						change some features and learn by exploration.
						With modern tools, you can even create similar materials yourself.
						<br>
						For instance, using Universe Sandbox application, you can literally make planet Mars collide
						with planet Venus and see the result.
						This simulates modern scientific theories about the world
						and displays all the physics of the process on your screen within a few minutes.
						Moreover, I am sure there is already, or definitely soon will be, a similar application
						for any scientific area.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="images/robot_generates.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						And the next huge thing is that modern AI assistants not only search for facts and information,
						but they also combine and even generate it successfully.
						We might even say they generate a kind of new, original content.
						Partly, it is true even for these slides.
						<br>
						So we get an enormous amount of information, and the challenge is that
						we don't know at all whether it is true.
						Here we encounter a fundamental problem: is it possible to verify the answers of assistant,
						that might be smarter than we are =)
						Or maybe we can at least align it with our goals and work together effectively.
						And in fact this question is most relevant for education,
						how to use modern technologies safely and for the benefit there?

						Now let's move on to the second part of the talk and let's discuss the influence
						of ChatGPT in education.<br><br>
						We start with the CHEGG company, which focused on improving learning
						and learning outcomes for students. This company, as many others,
						was hit hard by the launch of ChatGPT.
						<br><br>
						In May 2023, the company said, “In the FIRST PART of the year,
						we saw no noticeable impact from ChatGPT on our new account growth, and
						we were meeting expectations on new sign-ups.”
						<br><br>
						But students that paid Chegg to practice exams and get homework feedback turned to ChatGPT instead.
						As a result, the company share price decreased more than 40%.
						In Chegg’s August 2023 earnings call,
						the company already said, “We’ve pivoted the company to harness AI to better serve learners.”
						Now they’re building internal LLM in partnership with Scale AI.

									<br><br><br></em>
									</div>
								</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						And of course, students master new technologies just as well as you and I or even better.
						<br><br>
						Consider two typical examples from students of our educational program in Cyprus.
						NADEZHDA with her friends had one exam in the format of solving practical cases.
						They had to prepare using only two task samples from the teacher.
						So they added the theory from the slides of all the lectures into the GPT,
						followed it with exam samples. And asked it to generate
						similar samples based on the received theory.
						It was a superfast preparation for this kind of exam!
						<br><br>
						Let's look at another example from YAROSLAV.
						He was given some task, to write some kind of convolutional neural network.
						Initially, when looking at such a task, it is not always clear how to approach it and where to start.
						In the past, Google solved this, helping with existing solutions
						and showing how related tasks are done.
						<br><br>
						Now ChatGPT just writes the first version of code.
						Usually, approximately 20% of this code remains in the final version of neural network;
						sometimes it writes completely inadequate code, which, however, helps to understand what to Google next.
						In the following process of execution, Yaroslav uses ChatGPT as a bug fixer —
						it is not always possible to understand what the error is.
						You can throw the code into and ask to find and fix the error.
						Often the solutions it proposes are not workable, but lead to the insights to the problem.

						So what are the pros and cons of using ChatGPT in studying?
						<br><br>
						Let's begin with the USEFUL CASES.
						<br><br>
						It HELPS answer questions for tools with poor or inaccessible documentation

						<br><br>
						It PROVIDES nice and quick examples for some JSONs and other objects,

						<br><br>
						ONE of the main points: it helps to overcome the fear of a “blank slate.”
						<br><br>
						And WHAT it doesn't handle well:
						<br><br>
						Definitely it is ANY TASK where you have a large general context of the whole project.
						<br><br>
						ALSO, it is non-typical problems in not so popular areas:
						if you ask to solve a dynamic programming problem in Haskell, it gives funny answers,
						which are totally wrong.
						<br><br>
						CRUCIAL for us: for different mathematical facts a lot of the GPT-generated proofs are incorrect.

						You may ask why not using AI assistant, what is wrong with them?
						Let's DELVE into understanding what the issues are.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, there is a deliberate attempt to avoid copyright violation.
						This is an important consideration in today’s digital age.
						<br>
						NEXT, we must acknowledge that AI technology has not yet reached a point of complete reliability.
						This is crucial because over reliance on AI without proper verification
						can lead to significant issues in information security, protocol development, infrastructure,
						and other related domains.
						<br>
						THIRDLY, when it comes to programming languages such as C++ or Rust,
						human oversight is still required.
						<br>
						LASTLY, there are specific challenges that ChatGPT faces,
						such as difficulties in dealing with mathematical proofs.

						This limitation highlights that while ChatGPT is a sophisticated tool,
						it is not without shortcomings in certain complex analytical tasks.

						Let me share modern tools that can enhance and revolutionize
						the teaching workflow.
						<br>
						These tools aren't just about bringing efficiency to your tasks;
						they aim to prepare you for the future of education, which is increasingly techno-centric.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, I want to talk about PyCharm complemented with the TeXiFy IDEA plugin.
						This combination brings together LaTeX, Python, and JavaScript all into one place.
						But what makes it truly stand out is its powerful autocompletion feature and inverse search functionality.
						<br>
						NEXT, let's discuss the AI Assistant.
						This intelligent helper is capable of assisting with translations in a broader sense.
						It isn't just restricted to translating languages; it can convert formats,
						elaborate short ideas into detailed descriptions,
						convert text to oral speech, facilitate auto tests creation, and more.
						<br>
						THIRDLY, I'm using the Github Copilot plugin. It offers practical pieces of code,
						draft solutions, and generally helps speed up the writing of text content for your instructions or lectures.
						You can code faster and smarter with Copilot at your side.
						<br>
						LAST but not least, the Grazie Pro plugin is here to save the day.
						This software checks for typos and polishes long sentences.
						Its purpose is to ensure your text is clean, concise and clear before reaching your audience.
						<br>
						But remember, these tools serve to enhance your skills, not replace them.

						Here I'd like to show the concrete example from my own experience. It is producing
						the problem for the International Mathematical Competition.
						<br>
						First of all, I have chosen an appropriate problem from ancient times of my teaching
						at Novosibirsk State University.
						There I organized math contests for students.
						So I need to translate the problem from Russian to English and to make a Latex format from Microsoft Word.
						<br>
						You see, with the help of an AI assistant, I can do it in a few seconds.
						Then I check the result and look to the Grazie suggestion. Here I don't accept it.
						<br>
						Then I need to write a solution, so I think through the solution and type it in Latex format.
						Here you can see that GitHub Copilot helps me to write the solution quickly;
						it makes simple calculation with math formulas.
						<br>
						Eventually, I recompile Tex sources and get the final PDF file.

						Also I'd like to share with you a few observations from our teachers.
						<br><br>
						They NOTED the incredible speed of learning today.
						Essentially, as soon as new knowledge emerges,
						it becomes almost immediately available to everyone.
						This speed makes a significant impact.
						<br>
						For instance, IMAGINE we discover something on Twitter today.
						By tomorrow, we've already added a new skill to our repertoire.
						In just a week, all of our students have acquired this skill.
						<br>
						That's why the CRUCIAL skill nowadays becomes the ability to solve unsolved problems.
						<br>
						Our teachers ALSO highlighted certain essential activities for the development of critical thinking.
						<br>
						Those activities include crafting mathematical PROOFS,
						<br>
						DEBUGGING problems in code or systems,
						<br>
						tasks related to SYSTEM engineering, including robotics,
						<br>
						and, importantly, engaging in HUMAN discussions and debates.
						<br>
						Each activity, in its own way, sharpens
						our ability to evaluate information critically and make reasoned judgments.

						Let's talk about some of the practical use-cases of AI that teachers are utilizing today.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, AI can significantly streamline the creation of lecture materials.
						With a simple command, AI can help you generate a detailed lecture outline
						and even convert that outline into visually engaging slides using tools like reveal.js.
						This is a great example of how AI can facilitate the preparation process for educators.
						<br>
						NEXT, teachers are experimenting with AI's capabilities by checking the effectiveness
						of language learning models in answering assignment questions.
						This not only tests the AI's understanding but also helps to identify
						how students might use such technology to aid their learning.
						<br>
						In the realm of ART and visuals, DALL-E 3 is another remarkable tool.
						It's capable of creating beautiful, high-quality illustrations,
						whether in raster or in vector formats.
						These illustrations can then be used to enhance teaching materials and engage students.
						<br>
						LASTLY, AI is taking on the task of handling routine responsibilities.
						From drafting course syllables to managing other repetitive tasks,
						AI is opening up space for teachers to focus on more personalized and creative aspects of their work.
						This shift is paving the way for a more efficient allocation of time and resources in educational environments.

						As we reach the culmination of the presentation, I'd like to leave you with some pivotal thoughts.
						<br>
						FIRSTLY, the panorama of reliable information sources has undoubtedly evolved over the centuries.
						From the era of oral traditions to the digital age of AI, we have witnessed a monumental shift.
						Yet, amidst this evolution, one constant remains — the indispensable need
						for critical thinking and verification.
						In today's fast-paced world, this need is not just constant but has become more crucial than ever.
						<br>
						Secondly, the incredible speed at which information is now accessible presents us
						with unprecedented opportunities.
						It allows for swift learning, immediate access to knowledge,
						and the ability to connect globally.
						However, it also demands from us a heightened sense of discernment and responsibility.
						<br>
						As a COMPANY, embracing these changes means adapting and innovating.
						This brings me to the concept of 'JetBrains Copilot', integrated across our products,
						enhancing our workflow and decision-making process.
						<br>
						FINALLY, let us not just adapt but lead.
						We have the opportunity to be pioneers in integrating AI into education tools.
						By doing this, we can shape a smarter, more efficient learning environment —
						one that leverages the power of AI to enhance learning experiences and outcomes.
						<br>
						Your thoughts, FEEDBACK, and ideas are invaluable.
						I encourage you to connect with me — be it on Telegram, Github, or Instagram.
						Let's collaborate and shape the future of education together. Thank you.
