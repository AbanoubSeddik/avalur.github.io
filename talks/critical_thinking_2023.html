						Hello everyone! I'm Aleksandr Avdiushenko, and I am thrilled to have a talk on
		   				  the conference. Today we will discuss the evolution of education and
						  its interconnection with technology.

						  Let's start with the brief history of human education and knowledge sharing development.
						  <br>
						  So THE FIRST STOP of our journey is oral tradition.
						  It was the only way of sharing knowledge about three thousand Before Christ's Era:
						  In the earliest days of human civilization, information was transferred
						  orally from generation to generation.
						  Storytelling, folklore, and hands-on experiences were
						  the primary and the only methods for education.
						  <br>
						  So, oral speech is reliable!

						Birth of Writing and Numeracy <br> (circa 3,200 BCE)
					</div>
					  <aside class="notes">
						  Let's go on!
						  <br><br>
						  Around five thousand years ago, in ancient Mesopotamía,
						  the first known writing system, cuneiform, was developed.
						  This was closely tied with the invention of numbers and basic arithmetic,
						  which allowed for record-keeping and administration of transactions, mostly in marketplaces.
						  <br>
						  First of all, there were needed convenient notations and the ability to accumulate knowledge.
						  Fun thing to know about this piece of history is
						  that the first forms of writing were about accounting and credits
						  long precede the invention of money.
						  <br>
						  Well, clay tablets are reliable!

					<img src="images/babylonian_numerals.png" alt="babylonian_numerals">
					<aside class="notes">
						It is also interesting and quite well-known that cuneiform numerical notation was base sixty,
						unlike our base ten numbers, but they had a true place value system like we do, not like
						Roman numerals, for example. So the position of each digit within a number determines its value.

						  Ok, now we move on to the third stage, which was connected with Scrolls and Libraries.
						  <br>
						  The accumulation of knowledge led to the establishment of libraries,
						  such as the famous Library of Alexandria.
						  Scrolls made of papyrus or parchment were the primary means of storing and sharing information.
						  <br>
						  Well, papyrus is reliable!

						  Here we are close to modern time: the second half of the 20th century saw
						  the rise of computers and the Internet.
						  Information became digitized, leading to the creation of search engines like Google,
						  Yandex, Baidu, etc. This made accessing knowledge virtually instantaneous.

						In the current era, AI technologies like ChatGPT have emerged,
						providing personalized and interactive learning experiences.
						<br>
						These technologies engage users in conversations, answer all your questions,
						and help in learning,
						taking the interaction with information to a new level.
						Here I need to emphasize that your language almost is not important for the system anymore,
						because it simply understands and translates any language to the internal representation!
						<br>
						But is ChatGPT reliable? We will discuss it later.

					<h2>Information is extremely accessible!</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						The fact is that nowadays any information is extremely accessible!
						Even without an AI assistant, one has access to a massive amount of information.<br>
						For example, on YouTube, you can find an explanation for almost anything and to solve
						almost any problem, from repairing not working washing machine
						to executing the proper professional technique for a squat exercise, as we see here on slide.
						<br>
						Moreover, often, you can not only watch the video, but interact with the information,
						change some features and learn by exploration.
						With modern tools, you can even create similar materials yourself.
						<br>
						For instance, using Universe Sandbox application, you can literally make planet Mars collide
						with planet Venus and see the result.
						This simulates modern scientific theories about the world
						and displays all the physics of the process on your screen within a few minutes.
						Moreover, I am sure there is already, or definitely soon will be, a similar application
						for any scientific area.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background-image="images/robot_generates.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						And the next huge thing is that modern AI assistants not only search for facts and information,
						but they also generate it successfully. We might even say
						they generate a kind of new, original content. Partly, it is true even for these slides.
						<br>
						So we get an enormous amount of information, and the challenge is that
						we don't know at all whether it is true.
						Here we encounter a fundamental problem: is it possible to verify the answers of assistant,
						that might be smarter than we are =)
						Or maybe we can at least align it with our goals and work together effectively.

						Now let's move on to the second part of the talk and let's discuss the influence
						of ChatGPT in education.<br><br>
						We start with the CHEGG company, which focused on improving learning
						and learning outcomes for students. This company, as many others,
						was hit hard by the launch of ChatGPT.
						<br><br>
						In May 2023, the company said, “In the FIRST PART of the year,
						we saw no noticeable impact from ChatGPT on our new account growth, and
						we were meeting expectations on new sign-ups.”
						<br><br>
						But students that paid Chegg to practice exams and get homework feedback turned to ChatGPT instead.
						As a result, the company share price decreased more than 40%.
						In Chegg’s August 2023 earnings call,
						the company already said, “We’ve pivoted the company to harness AI to better serve learners.”
						Now they’re building internal LLM in partnership with Scale AI.

					<aside class="notes">
						And of course, students master new technologies just as well as you and I or even better.
						<br><br>
						Consider two typical examples from students of our educational program in Cyprus.
						NADEZHDA with her friends had one exam in the format of solving practical cases.
						They had to prepare using only two task samples from the teacher.
						So they added the theory from the slides of all the lectures into the GPT,
						followed it with exam samples. And asked it to generate
						similar samples based on the received theory.
						It was a superfast preparation for this kind of exam!
						<br><br>
						Let's look to another example, from YAROSLAV.
						He was given some task, to write some kind of convolutional neural network.
						Initially, when looking at such a task, it is not always clear how to approach it and where to start.
						In the past, Google solved this, helping with existing solutions
						and showing how related tasks are done.
						<br><br>
						Now ChatGPT writes the first version of code.
						Usually, approximately 20% of this code remains in the final version of neural network;
						sometimes it writes completely inadequate code, which, however, helps to understand what to Google next.
						In the following process of execution, Yaroslav uses ChatGPT as a bug fixer —
						it is not always possible to understand what the error is.
						You can throw the code into and ask to find and fix the error.
						Often the solutions it proposes are not workable, but lead to the insights to the problem.

						So what are the pros and cons of using ChatGPT in studying?
						<br><br>
						Let's begin with the USEFUL CASES.
						<br><br>
						It HELPS answer questions for tools with poor or inaccessible documentation
						(for example, it can tell you how to start using GNU Debugger).
						<br><br>
						It PROVIDES nice and quick examples for some JSONs and other objects,
						or some values to fill in the database.
						<br><br>
						ONE of the main points: it helps to overcome the fear of a “blank slate.”
						<br><br>
						And WHAT it doesn't handle well:
						<br><br>
						Definitely it is ANY TASK where you have a large general context of the whole project.
						<br><br>
						ALSO, it is non-typical problems in not so popular areas:
						if you ask to solve a dynamic programming problem in Haskell, it gives funny answers,
						which are totally wrong.
						<br><br>
						CRUCIAL for us: for different mathematical facts about 50% of the GPT-generated proofs are incorrect.

						You may ask why not, what is wrong with them?
						Let's DELVE into understanding what the issues are.
						<br><br>
						FIRSTLY, there is a deliberate attempt to avoid copyright violation.
						This is an important consideration in today’s digital age.
						<br>
						NEXT, we must acknowledge that AI technology has not yet reached a point of complete reliability.
						This is crucial because over reliance on AI without proper verification
						can lead to significant issues in information security, protocol development, infrastructure,
						and other related domains.
						<br><br>
						THIRDLY, when it comes to programming languages such as C++ or Rust,
						human oversight is still required.
						<br><br>
						LASTLY, there are specific challenges that ChatGPT faces,
						such as difficulties in dealing with mathematical proofs.
						<br><br>
						This limitation highlights that while ChatGPT is a sophisticated tool,
						it is not without shortcomings in certain complex analytical tasks.

						They NOTED the incredible speed of learning today.
						Essentially, as soon as new knowledge emerges,
						it becomes almost immediately available to everyone.
						This speed makes a significant impact.
						<br><br>
						For instance, IMAGINE we discover something on Twitter today.
						By tomorrow, we've already added a new skill to our repertoire.
						In just a week, all of our students have acquired this skill.
						<br><br>
						That's why the CRUCIAL skill nowadays becomes the ability to solve unsolved problems.

						Our teachers ALSO highlighted certain essential activities for the development of critical thinking.
						<br><br>
						Those activities include crafting mathematical PROOFS,

						debugging problems in CODE or systems,
						<br><br>
						tasks related to SYSTEM engineering, including robotics,

						Let's talk about some of the practical applications of AI that teachers are utilizing today.
						<br><br>
						FIRSTLY, AI can significantly streamline the creation of lecture materials.
						With a simple command, AI can help you generate a detailed lecture outline
						and even convert that outline into visually engaging slides using tools like reveal.js.
						This is a great example of how AI can facilitate the preparation process for educators.
						<br><br>
						NEXT, teachers are experimenting with AI's capabilities by checking the effectiveness
						of language learning models in answering assignment questions.
						This not only tests the AI's understanding but also helps to identify
						how students might use such technology to aid their learning.
						<br><br>
						In the realm of ART and visuals, DALL-E 3 is another remarkable tool.
						It's capable of creating beautiful, high-quality illustrations,
						whether in pencil or vector formats.
						These illustrations can then be used to enhance teaching materials and engage students.
						<br><br>
						LASTLY, AI is taking on the task of handling routine responsibilities.
						From drafting course syllables to managing other repetitive tasks,
						AI is opening up space for teachers to focus on more personalized and creative aspects of their work.
						This shift is paving the way for a more efficient allocation of time and resources in educational environments.
