# Tetris AI Development Report

## Overview  
This report documents the process of improving an AI agent for Tetris, focusing on enhancing its heuristic evaluation and implementing advanced search techniques like Beam Search. Each step of development is detailed, including algorithmic insights, implementation details, and performance analysis.

## 1. Baseline Heuristic Agent  

### Initial Approach  
The initial heuristic agent evaluated the Tetris board using four metrics:  
- **Aggregate Height**: Penalizes tall stacks that limit playability.  
- **Complete Lines**: Rewards cleared lines to progress in the game.  
- **Holes**: Penalizes gaps below blocks, making it harder to clear lines.  
- **Bumpiness**: Penalizes uneven surfaces that reduce placement options.  

The evaluation function:  

```javascript
function evaluateBoard(board) {
    return (
        -0.51 * aggregateHeight + 
        0.76 * completeLines - 
        0.36 * holes - 
        0.18 * bumpiness
    );
}
```

### Limitations  
While effective for basic scenarios, the heuristic lacked depth:  
1. It only evaluated the current board state, neglecting future implications.  
2. It ignored advanced metrics such as well structures or blockades.

## 2. Enhanced Heuristic Agent  

### Improvements  
The agent's evaluation function was expanded with additional features:  
- **Well Sum**: Penalizes vertical gaps surrounded by blocks.  
- **Blockades**: Tracks blocks above holes, making them harder to fill.  
- **Max Height Penalty**: Heavily penalizes unmanageably tall columns.  

The revised evaluation function:  

```javascript
function evaluateBoard(board) {
    return (
        (heightWeight * aggregateHeight) +
        (linesWeight * completeLines) +
        (holesWeight * holes) +
        (bumpinessWeight * bumpiness) +
        (wellSumWeight * wellSum) +
        (blockadeWeight * blockades) +
        maxHeightPenalty
    );
}
```

### Look-Ahead Strategy  
To enhance decision-making, the agent incorporated a look-ahead mechanism. By evaluating potential moves for the next piece, the agent balanced the current and future board states:  

```javascript
function selectBestMove(piece, board) {
    const moves = getPossibleMoves(piece);
    let bestMove = null;
    let bestScore = -Infinity;
    
    moves.forEach(move => {
        let score = evaluateBoard(move.board);
        
        const nextPiece = next;
        if (nextPiece) {
            const nextMoves = getPossibleMoves({...nextPiece, x: 0, y: 0});
            const bestNextScore = Math.max(
                ...nextMoves.map(nextMove => evaluateBoard(nextMove.board))
            );
            score = score * 0.7 + bestNextScore * 0.3;
        }
        
        if (score > bestScore) {
            bestScore = score;
            bestMove = move;
        }
    });
    
    return bestMove;
}
```

### Results  
The enhanced heuristic significantly improved gameplay, reducing errors caused by shortsighted decisions.

## 3. Beam Search Agent  

### Algorithm Description  
Beam Search expands the agent's ability to evaluate multiple paths simultaneously. Instead of committing to a single move, it tracks the most promising sequences of moves.  

The algorithm processes:  
1. **Initialization**: A "beam" of potential game states is created.  
2. **Expansion**: For each state, all possible moves are simulated.  
3. **Evaluation and Pruning**: States are scored using the heuristic and pruned to retain only the top candidates.  
4. **Iteration**: Steps 2-3 are repeated for a predefined depth.  

The agent implementation:  

```javascript
class BeamSearchAgent {
    getBestMove(currentPiece, board, nextPieces) {
        let beam = [{
            board: copyBlocks(board),
            score: 0,
            moves: [],
            linesCleared: 0
        }];

        for (let depth = 0; depth < this.depth; depth++) {
            let candidates = [];
            
            beam.forEach(state => {
                const piece = nextPieces[depth];
                const moves = this.getPossibleMoves(piece, state.board);
                
                moves.forEach(move => {
                    const newBoard = this.applyMove(move, state.board);
                    const linesCleared = this.clearLines(newBoard);
                    const score = this.evaluateState(newBoard, state.score, linesCleared);
                    
                    candidates.push({
                        board: newBoard,
                        score: score,
                        moves: [...state.moves, move],
                        linesCleared: state.linesCleared + linesCleared
                    });
                });
            });
            
            beam = this.selectTopStates(candidates, this.beamWidth);
        }

        return beam[0].moves[0];
    }
}
```

### Results  
The Beam Search agent outperformed the heuristic-based agent in scenarios requiring long-term planning. By exploring multiple paths, it demonstrated better adaptability and line-clearing efficiency.
